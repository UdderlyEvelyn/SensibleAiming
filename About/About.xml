  In Rimworld, pawns seem to miss entirely too often with ranged weapons. This is because it's all dice rolls - often not taking shooting skills into account even. This mod aims to fix it in a lightweight and close-to-vanilla way by simply involving the shooting skill in those dice rolls to tighten the aiming up more and even things up between ranged and melee combat.
